TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on adau1761_adc_sdata relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on adau1761_bclk relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on adau1761_cout relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on adau1761_lrclk relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on adau1761_cclk relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on adau1761_cdata relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on adau1761_clatchn relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
